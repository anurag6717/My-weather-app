### Weather App
In this repository,  I am gonna showing to you how to code a weather app with javascript. in this repository also we use a weather api and we get data from api❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api key (in repository we showed how!) and replace it in index.js file on line 9 :

```javascript
const APIKey = 'Your Api Key';
```
